# HVDC-Wise Extensions

## Overview
HVDC-Wise Extensions include extensions for Common Information Model (CIM) to enable data exchange of HVDC equipment. 

## Available Formats
HVDC-Wise Extensions are currently avaible in HVDC-Wise Lib in two export formats:
- **XML Export:** [HVDC-WISE_Extensions.xml](../../../Data_exchange_specifications/CIM_extensions/HVDC-WISE_Extensions.xml) is a native export of the Enterprise Architect package. 
- **Word document:** [HVDC-WISE_Extensions.docx](../../../Data_exchange_specifications/CIM_extensions/HVDC-WISE_Extensions.docx) is an export from Enterprise Architect in Word. This is used as human-readable version of the extensions. It is done in a similar way as in the IEC standards.

2. **Import the XML File in EA**
   - Open the master Enterprise Architect project in Enterprise Architect.
